| **Enterprise Adoption** | High (Google, IBM, Boeing) | Medium | ✅ More trusted |

**Example Cost Calculation:**
- 1,000 positions/day for 30 days = 30,000 transactions
- Hedera: 30,000 × $0.0001 = **$3/month**
- Ethereum: 30,000 × $10 = **$300,000/month**

**Verdict:** Ethereum is 100,000x more expensive for the same functionality.

### Why Hedera Over Solana?

| Metric | Hedera | Solana | Advantage |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Network Stability** | 100% uptime | Multiple outages | ✅ More reliable |
| **Transaction Fee** | $0.0001 | $0.00025 | ✅ 2.5x cheaper |
| **Finality** | 3-5 seconds | 2-3 seconds | ≈ Similar |
| **Governance** | Council (stable) | Token-based (volatile) | ✅ More stable |
| **Enterprise Focus** | High | Medium | ✅ Better for B2B |

**Verdict:** Hedera is more reliable and stable for production infrastructure.

### Why Hedera Over Polygon?

| Metric | Hedera | Polygon | Advantage |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Transaction Fee** | $0.0001 | $0.001-0.01 | ✅ 10-100x cheaper |
| **Native Layer** | L1 (native) | L2 (depends on Ethereum) | ✅ More independent |
| **Consensus** | Hashgraph (aBFT) | PoS (probabilistic) | ✅ Stronger guarantees |
| **Throughput** | 10,000 TPS | 7,000 TPS | ✅ Higher |

**Verdict:** Hedera is cheaper and more independent.

| **Blockchain** | Hedera | Solana (migrated from own) | ✅ More stable |
| **Hardware Cost** | $100-500 | $500-1000 | ✅ Lower barrier |
| **Immediate Value** | Yes (tracking data) | Depends on coverage | ✅ Faster ROI |

**Verdict:** HederaSky has clearer value proposition and lower entry cost.

### HederaSky vs Hivemapper (Mapping)

| Feature | HederaSky | Hivemapper | Advantage |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Data Type** | Aircraft positions | Street imagery | ≈ Different markets |
| **Update Frequency** | Real-time | Periodic | ✅ More dynamic |
| **Hardware** | Stationary receivers | Mobile dashcams | ≈ Different models |
| **Blockchain** | Hedera | Solana | ✅ More stable |
| **Competition** | FlightRadar24 | Google Maps | ≈ Both face giants |

## Comparison with Non-Blockchain Alternatives

### HederaSky vs Traditional Database

| Feature | HederaSky (Blockchain) | Traditional DB | Advantage |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Data Integrity** | Immutable, cryptographic | Mutable, admin-controlled | ✅ Tamper-proof |
| **Incentive Mechanism** | Built-in (tokens) | Manual (payments) | ✅ Automated |
| **Transparency** | Public, auditable | Private, opaque | ✅ Trustworthy |
| **Decentralization** | Yes | No | ✅ No single point of failure |
| **Cost** | $0.0001/tx + hosting | Hosting only | ⚠️ Slightly higher |
| **Complexity** | Higher | Lower | ⚠️ More complex |

**When to use blockchain:**
- ✅ Need immutable audit trail
- ✅ Multiple untrusted parties
- ✅ Automated incentives required
- ✅ Transparency is valuable

**When traditional DB is fine:**
- Single trusted operator
- No need for transparency
- No incentive mechanism needed
- Cost is primary concern

**Verdict:** For DePIN, blockchain is essential. The small extra cost enables the entire business model.
