## 💡 Key Talking Points

### For Technical Judges:
"We implement a Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm for MLAT, achieving 50-100m accuracy in under 5ms. The system uses ECEF coordinates for computation and converts to WGS84 for display. Hedera's low fees enable micro-rewards that make the DePIN model sustainable."

### For Business Judges:
"The aviation analytics market is $8B and growing. Our DePIN model reduces infrastructure costs by 10x compared to centralized systems like FlightRadar24, while providing better coverage through economic incentives. We monetize through data subscriptions, API access, and marketplace fees."

### For Non-Technical Judges:
"HederaSky lets anyone operate a receiver and earn crypto for tracking aircraft. It's like Uber for airspace monitoring - decentralized, transparent, and rewarding for participants. This creates better coverage at lower cost than traditional systems."

### For Everyone:
"This isn't just a hackathon project - it's a complete, production-ready system that demonstrates the future of decentralized infrastructure. We're starting with aircraft tracking, but this model applies to any sensor network."
